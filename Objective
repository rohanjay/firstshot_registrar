Objective: summarize the contents of a CSV file using AI, ML, NLP, and other tools:
Import necessary libraries: The first step is to import libraries like pandas, NLTK, and other NLP tools that will be used in the script.
Allow user to identify CSV file: The script should prompt the user to input the path and name of the CSV file that they want to summarize.
Read and process the CSV file: The script should use pandas to read the CSV file and process it row by row.
Apply NLP tools: The script should use NLP tools like tokenization, named entity recognition, and sentiment analysis to analyze the text in each row.
Generate a summary: Using the results from the NLP tools, the script should generate a summary of the contents of each row in up to 30 words. The summary should be clear, concise, and relevant to the content of the row.
Add external sources: To add clarity to each summary, the script should use external sources like Wikipedia, news articles, or other online resources to provide additional context.
Add the summary to each row: The script should add the resulting summary to the end of each row in a new column.
Export the updated CSV file: Finally, the script should use pandas to export the updated CSV file with the added summary column.
